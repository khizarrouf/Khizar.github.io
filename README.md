### Project 1 - Predict Mortgage Defaults Using Freddie Mac Datasets.
[Details and code available here](https://github.com/khizarrouf/End_to_End_Mortgage_Default_Project)
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Developed a classification model to predict whether a home loan will default or not. </span> 
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Gathered large data sets from the Freddie Mac website and visualized in Tableau. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Preprocessed the data in Azure ML using Python libraries. Performed outlier detection with a scalable unsupervised outlier detection framework. The data was stratified to ensure representative coverage across all states. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Trained a neural network to minimize false negatives and maximize ROC AUC. The modelâ€™s performance was tracked with MLflow. The penalty functions were applied to address class imbalance. A custom batch sampler class was implemented to further refine the model's training process. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Performed SHAP to identify important features and their contributions. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Deployed the model locally via FastAPI for inference. </span>

### Project 2 - Predict Effective Properties of Materials Based on Microstructure and Constituent Properties.
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Developed a supervised regression model to predict the effective properties of a material based on its microstructure and constituent properties. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Automated dataset generation in simulation software by developing and implementing Python scripts. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Identified and removed outliers using the standard deviation method and normalized the data to scale features for better model performance.  </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Trained and validated Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and XGBoost models to predict the effective properties of the material. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> The trained model significantly reduced the inference time compared to the conventional modeling approach, while maintaining the same level of accuracy. </span>
