 ### <font color="green">  *Project 1 - Predict Mortgage Defaults Using Freddie Mac Datasets.* </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Developed a classification model to predict whether a home loan will default or not. </span> 
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Gathered large data sets from the Freddie Mac website and visualized in Tableau. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Preprocessed the data in Azure ML using Python libraries. Performed outlier detection with a scalable unsupervised outlier detection framework. The data was stratified to ensure representative coverage across all states. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Trained a neural network to minimize false negatives and maximize ROC AUC. The modelâ€™s performance was tracked with MLflow. The penalty functions were applied to address class imbalance. A custom batch sampler class was implemented to further refine the model's training process. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Performed SHAP to identify important features and their contributions. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 14px;"> Deployed the model locally via FastAPI for inference. </span>
